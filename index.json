The wights lead by Nightking tries to invade the whole Westeros(the humans land).\n Prerequisites: To run this application Java development Kit(jdk) has to be installed in the system and that’s it.Javafx run machine will be included in it. JDK can be installed from the Oracle’s official website under Java SE Development Kit (latest ver 13.0).\n Into the Project The Entire project is made using JavaFX library and the fxml files are built using Gluon SceneBuilder.As this is a dynamic game,the Animation timer class available in JavaFX is used to update every frame of the game accordingly .\nThe characters and weapons used by the characters are the instances of Imageview class which are added on a child node of a scene named ground.\n How to Play The controls of the game are the horizantal arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot (or use) the weapon.\nThere are four knights to fight the wights with their weapons. Each knight has same level of health bar but with different strengths to kill the wights.one might take one shot or two to kill the wights. The knights have a dragon which breaths fire it can kill a massive amount of wights but it can be used only limited times and the dead army(wights) also has a dragon but it breathes blue fire which can kill a knight with one breath. It can attack at any time of the game.\nThe motive of the game is to defend Westeros from the dead army using the knights.\nThis is the user interface of the game\n Running the Game The whole project is constitution of 2 java files and two fxml files Running the Main.java runs the game.It can be done through cmd in windows or terminal in linux.\nRunning the Main.java file through command line\njavac Main.java java Main   Running the Jar File Without running the program we can directly run the jar file of the program and play the game.\nRunning the jar file through command line\njava -jar LambdaSpaceInvaders.jar   Built With  Intellij IDEA - Development environment used JavaFX - Library and Software Platform used. Gluon Scenebuilder- Layout tool used to design the UI.   Acknowledgments  Hat tip to Almas Baimagambetov from whom the guidance to use Animation timer is taken. Theme inspiration from Game of thrones - an Epic fantasy TV Series.
